Never Forget Your Schedule!

Hi! I made a webpage to help people keep track of their schedules during the day. As a student keeping track of all the things I have to do can be really challenging. This can also help with time management. When used you can see all your hours that you have available and plan accordingly. This wedsite has a calendar that can help a student keep track of their schedule. I made the hours from 9-5 becuase thats a normal business hours. While creating this I got to practice using third party APIs and I learnt how easy it is to incorporate them into my codes. I hope this webpage can help others the way its helping me.
